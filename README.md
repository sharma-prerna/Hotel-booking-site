# PROJECT SCHEDULING AND PLANNING
## PROJECT DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGIES
There exists several standard methodologies to accomplish a project successfully. Such methodologies specify the procedures right from the scratch till the very end of the project. This standardizes the method and provides a systematic approach to plan, design, implement and maintain large projects. The methods may be sequential, such as the Waterfall model or cyclic such as the Spiral model. These methodologies are chosen on the basis of the importance of the project, the criticality and risk involved, and the number of members required.
## CHOSEN METHODOLOGY
The Waterfall method was adopted for the development of the project due to the following factors:
1)	Simplicity of the waterfall model
2)	Number of team members are less hence less focus is to be given on coordination
3)	Low risk involved, as per the risk analysis conducted (shown above)
4)	Requirements known already hence Waterfall model is the most suitable.

The various stages involved in the project development were:
1. Requirements analysis and definition: The entire project idea was analyzed and was checked for feasibility. The expectations or goals from the project were listed, and the problem statement was formally defined and tasks were identified.
2. System and software design: The modules were designed and the tasks were distributed. The constraints and limitations were discussed and diagrams, DFDs and charts were drawn to comprehend the problem. Data requirements were identified and tables were created and normalized.
3. Implementation: During this stage, the design was realized as a set of PHP scripts. However, the pages were isolated and were yet to be integrated as a unit.
4. Integration and system testing: The individual program units were integrated and tested as a complete system to ensure that the software requirements have been met.
